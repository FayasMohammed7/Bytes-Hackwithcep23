## Link to Project
[Embed the live link of project](live_link)

## How it Works ?
The homepage of the website has a number of options, including a list of the 'supporting companies', an interactive map system, and a live monitoring of energy produced by each company's building. By selecting the 'Supporting companies' option, a new webpage will appear with a list of the companies involved. The site allows us to track the live updates of each company in regards to the Units/day, KiloWatt/hr, Credits Earned, and detailed reports. An interactive map system shows companies involved as markers and an animation pattern follows to the slums that receive the energy. Each marker on the map will contain a link, which will take the viewer to the monitoring webpage of the corresponding company.

## Technologies used
Integrated Vertical Wind Mill Solar Panel, Interactive Map system, Python, Html, CSS, Java Script
